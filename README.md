# This Project

Since I really like birds, I wanted to make something where people could share pictures of their birds, ask question, and more. Since the basic idea of this works in the same way as most Social Media, blogging websites, or anything with posts, I should learn many skills that would be very applicable from this project. I am also using React Router for the web portion of this project in order to learn more about routing.

## Birb Check Backend

### What is it

This is the backend portion of the project, built with MongoDB, Express, and Node. Since this is the sort of _'default setup'_ I have been using, I assume, in the next project, I will try to switch things up, and use MySQL/MariaDB, or something different than MongoDB with Express. I will, however, learn more about the process of creating a backend with MongoDB, Express, and Node (i.e. solidifying my understanding).

## Birb Check React

### What This Is

This is a frontend of this project. I am using React to get a deeper understanding of it, learn react-router, and because it is probably the most popular framework right now (some people may argue for Vue). The goal with react-router is to use it so that you can go to an image sharing page, a posts page, and pages for each user. This should teach me not only how to create static link (posts and images), but also dynamic ones (user). I will also learn how to upload and use images with react.
